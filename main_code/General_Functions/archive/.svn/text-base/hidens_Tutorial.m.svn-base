%% HiDens Tutorial
% This Tutorial gives an overwiev over the HiDens MATLAB package and explains
% the most important functions and how to use them. 
% You will use these functions to load, process and visualize data that was
% recorded with the HiDens chip and to apply the spike sorting algorithm.
%
% The tutorial is divided in three pages:
%
% # How to load and process raw recorded data is shown in
% *<matlab:open('tutorialA.html') Processing raw data>*
% # How to do spike sorting and all functions dealing with sorted neurons are
% shown in *<matlab:open('tutorialB.html') Spike Sorting and Neruons Processing>*
% # Additional usefull functions are explained in 
% *<matlab:open('tutorialC.html') Additional tools>*
